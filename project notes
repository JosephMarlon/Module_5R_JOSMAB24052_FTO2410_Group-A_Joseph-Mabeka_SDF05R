For this project, I implemented three unique animation styles for buttons:

Button 1: When clicked, the background color changes to blue and the text color turns white for better visibility.

Button 2: This button shakes when clicked, adding a dynamic effect.

Button 3: On click, this button grows in size and has a blue background.

The most exciting aspect of this project was writing the code myself, as opposed to using pre-made styles on platforms like WordPress. It was rewarding to have the ability to create these animations from scratch.

I utilized various techniques, including:

Pseudo-elements: To add styles without extra markup.

Translate: To move elements within the DOM.

Transition: For smooth state changes.

Transform: To scale, rotate, and move elements.

@keyframes: To define animation sequences.
